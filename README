      {

      bundlesequence => {
         # Global bundle
            "global",

         # Run Policy Update
            "update",

                 # Common bundles first for best practice
                    "def",

        };
        
      inputs => {
      
            # COPBL/Custom libraries
            "cfengine_stdlib.cf",

                  package_policy => "addupdate",
                  package_method => fluent_gem_pkg;
             
             any::
